<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Learner Profile</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shae, 20, is starting the third year of an undergraduate degree in computer science
    after doing a one-semester work placement at a local mobile application development company.</li>
<li>Shae is comfortable with object-oriented programming in Python,
    and did well in their introductory courses on databases and web programming.
    They like working on homework assignments with friends,
    but had a bad experience in the team project in the web programming class.
    They use VS Code and Claude,
    but still mostly debug with print statements.</li>
<li>Shae found their work placement exciting because they got to work on real problems,
    but bewildering because they felt they spent more time in meetings than they did doing "real" work.
    They also heard senior programmers arguing about whether AI is a boon or a curse,
    and would like to know how to answer questions like that.</li>
<li>Shae is impatient with abstract theory;
    they learn best when generalizing from practical examples.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These lessons teach Shae how to think analytically about software development processes,
how to model and analyze those processes,
and how to distinguish evidence-based claims from plausible punditry.</p>
